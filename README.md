# Bank
My implementation of the Bank kata. You can find the description of the kata [here](https://katalyst.codurance.com/bank)

The bank kata has been implemented in the following different ways:
* With an in memory database
* With Kafka
* With Redis
* Using a seamless green aproach

The project has 4 implementations which you can find in different branches of this project.

> Note: Redis and Kafka implementations will require some modifications on the configuration of those services.
