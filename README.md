# Bank
My implementation of the Bank kata. You can find the description of the kata [here](https://katalyst.codurance.com/bank)

The bank kata has been implemented in the following different ways:
* With an in memory database ==> [master](https://github.com/apavlidi/Bank/tree/master)
* With Kafka ==> [kafka](https://github.com/apavlidi/Bank/tree/kafka)
* With Redis ==> [redis](https://github.com/apavlidi/Bank/tree/redis)
* Using a seamless green aproach ==> [seamless_green](https://github.com/apavlidi/Bank/tree/seamless_green)

The project has 4 implementations which you can find in different branches of this project.

> Note: Redis and Kafka implementations will require some modifications on the configuration of those services.
